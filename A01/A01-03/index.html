        <p>In 1980,physicist Tim Berners-Lee,a contractor at CERN,proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE,a  system  for CERN researchers to use and share documents.In 1989 ,Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an 
        Internet-based hypertext systm.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and worte the  browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert  Cailliau collaborated
        on a joint request for funding,but the project was not formally adopted by CERN.In his personal notes  of 1990,Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used";an encyclopedia is the 
        first entry
