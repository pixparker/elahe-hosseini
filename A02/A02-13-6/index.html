                <h1>Ocean</h1>
               <p>The ocean (also known as the sea or the
                world ocean) is a body of salt water that 
                covers approximately 70.8% of the earth and contains 97%
                of Earth's watre.The term ocean also refers to any
                of the large bodies of water into which the world ocean 
                is conventionally divided.Distinct names are used to identify
                five different areas of the ocean: Pacific (the largest),Atlantic,
                Indian,Southern, and Arctic(the smallest).Seawater covers  approximately
                361,000,000km2 (139,000,000 sq mi) of the plane.The ocean is the 
                primary component of the Earth's hydrosphere, and thus essential to life on Earth's
                hydrosphere,and thus essential to life on Eart.The ocean influences climate
                and weather patters,the carbon cycle,and the water cycle by acting as a huge heat
                reservoir.
